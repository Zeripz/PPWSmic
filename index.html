                    <h2>Emerging Post Pandemic Trends of Research and Education in Mathematics and Sciences</h2>
                    <p>Covid 19 brings dramatic changes in all sectors of life. Education has changed with the
                        distinctive rise of e-learning. Learning experiences during the pandemic are carried out
                        with the concept of digital education undertaken on many platforms. Higher education is
                        forced to accelerate the implementation of this online learning style. Although universities
                        have e- learning ecosystems in place, yet these environments are mostly designed for blended
                        learning. Predictions about movement in the post pandemic time, whether implementing the
                        pre-existing models of blended learning or moving into a flexible and agile learning
                        ecosystem in line with 5th industrial revolution are still a debatable issue. Constraints
                        faced while learning from home, will provide experience in the implementation of
                        post-pandemic education.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Education hasnâ€™t been the only field impacted by pandemic. Economy, health and human
                        well-being were also suffering from it. research is needed to make feasible concrete ways of
                        surviving. Unfortunately, the research pattern is disrupted due to the need of effort in
                        being able to live side by side with the virus. Unpredicted noticeable huge innovations even
                        appear which were never thought of before.
                    </p>
                    <p> Science, mathematics and education play an important role in adapting to the new world in
                        the
                        post pandemic era. The third Science and Mathematics International Conference (SMIC) aims to
                        bring together academics, scientists, students, and practitioners to share and discuss
                        theoretical and practical knowledge, new trends and application in those fields related to
                        post
                        pandemic issues. The previous 1st and 2nd conference has brought huge success in aligning
                        more
                        than 6 countries participants in the events and delivering to international reputable book
                        as
                        well as proceeding.</p>
                    <p>
                        3rd SMIC 2022 will be held on 7 September by Online Mode. The conference definitely provides
                        ideal academic platform for researches to present their latest work in the emerging post
                        pandemic trends of research and education in Mathematics and Sciences.
